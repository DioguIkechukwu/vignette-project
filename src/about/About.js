        <p>
          Vignette had one vision; we want to make those who want to start a
          VTuber career a more accessible path.
        </p>
        <p>Made for you, by you.</p>
        <p>
          And that was our mission: to build a product to make these independent
          content creators become their own VTubers without using any
          specialized hardware and relatively low price. We won't gather data
          from you or sell DLCs, or give a half-complete product to you.
          Vignette and it's entire features will be forever free, no gotchas.*
